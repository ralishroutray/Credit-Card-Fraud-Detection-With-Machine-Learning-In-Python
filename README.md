# Project Overview

This project aims to compare various machine learning models to identify the one that performs best on a given dataset. The dataset appears to be related to financial transactions, possibly for fraud detection, given the features like `Time`, `Amount`, and various anonymized features `V1` to `V28`. The steps taken in this project are outlined below:

## Step 1: Data Preparation
- **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame for analysis and processing.
- **Data Cleaning**: Any missing values or outliers in the dataset are addressed to ensure the quality of the data.
- **Feature Selection**: Features that are most relevant to the prediction task are selected. In this case, all features provided (`Time`, `V1` to `V28`, and `Amount`) are used.

## Step 2: Data Splitting
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models. This ensures that the model's performance is assessed on unseen data.

## Step 3: Model Training
Several machine learning models are trained on the dataset:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Decision Tree**
- **XGBoost**

Each model is trained using the training data, and its parameters are tuned as necessary to achieve optimal performance.

## Step 4: Model Evaluation
- **Testing**: Each model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its performance in terms of accuracy.
- **Comparison**: The accuracies of all models are compared to identify which model performs the best on the test data.

## Step 5: Conclusion
- The model with the highest accuracy on the test data is identified as the best model for this specific dataset.
- The findings are summarized, and recommendations are made based on the model's performance.

This project provides insights into the effectiveness of different machine learning models for the task at hand and identifies the most suitable model based on test accuracy.
